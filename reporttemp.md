# Proto-Honeypot Project Progress Report

## Executive Summary
Proto-Honeypot is a next-generation, stealth-oriented honeypot solution written in Rust, designed for seamless integration with a Supabase-powered web dashboard. The system enables security teams to deploy, monitor, and manage distributed honeypots with minimal operational overhead and maximum concealment from adversaries.

## Architecture Overview
- **Core Engine:** Rust-based, cross-platform (Linux, Windows, WSL) binary with async networking, modular config, and robust error handling.
- **Web Dashboard:** React + Supabase frontend for pairing, monitoring, and log/event review. Backend powered by Supabase (PostgreSQL, REST API, Realtime).
- **Integration:** Honeypot agents communicate securely with the dashboard via REST API, using pairing codes and API keys for authentication.

## Features Delivered
### Deployment & Onboarding
- **Automated First-Run Experience:** On initial execution, the tool generates a default configuration and populates a fake filesystem, ensuring zero manual setup.
- **Interactive Pairing:** Prompts user for dashboard-generated pairing code, securely registers the honeypot with the backend.
- **Stealth Mode:** Sets a non-obvious process name ("systemd-journal" on Linux) to evade attacker detection; runs quietly in the background.

### Operation & Monitoring
- **Active Listener Mode:** Listens on multiple TCP/UDP ports, emulating real services and capturing attacker interactions.
- **Real-Time Event Reporting:** All connection attempts and suspicious activity are logged and sent to Supabase in real time; no sensitive data is stored locally.
- **Dashboard Synchronization:** Honeypot status, logs, and events are visible in the dashboard; supports pairing, live activity, and log review.

### Security & Usability
- **Uninstall Workflow:** Comprehensive uninstall script removes all honeypot artifacts (filesystem, config, binary, iptables rules) and deregisters the honeypot from the dashboard via Supabase API.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Fully tested in Kali WSL and Windows environments; clear, user-friendly commands for setup, operation, and testing.
- **Attack Simulation:** Supports attacker emulation from both Linux and Windows for validation and demonstration purposes.

## Validation & Testing
- **Pairing Registration:** Verified successful honeypot registration in Supabase honeypots table; dashboard reflects new pairings after refresh.
- **Event Logging:** Simulated attacks (TCP/UDP/HTTP) from both WSL and Windows; confirmed logs/events are captured and transmitted to backend.
- **Dashboard Integration:** Ensured logs and honeypot status are visible in dashboard; provided prompt for enabling live updates and fixing UI buttons.
- **Uninstall Verification:** Uninstall script tested to remove all traces and deregister honeypot from backend.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- **Dashboard Enhancements:** Implement live updates (Supabase Realtime or polling) and fix "View"/"Logs" buttons for seamless UX.
- **Advanced Stealth:** Optionally run as a service, further obfuscate process, or integrate with system startup for persistent operation.
- **Extended Event Types:** Enrich event schema with more metadata (source IP, payload, protocol, geolocation, etc.) for deeper analysis.
- **Documentation:** Expand README and user guides with architecture diagrams, troubleshooting, and advanced deployment scenarios.
- **Security Review:** Conduct code audit and penetration testing to ensure operational security and resilience against evasion.

## Project Status (as of September 3, 2025)
- All core features implemented and validated.
- Tool is production-ready for stealth honeypot deployment and dashboard integration.
- User experience, onboarding, and uninstall workflows are streamlined and robust.
- Dashboard integration is functional; further UI/UX polish recommended.
